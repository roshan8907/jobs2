Location: Greater London

About Ankar
The way companies innovate is broken. The systems built to create and protect ideas can’t keep up with the pace of change. Today, 90% of S&P 500 company value is intangible (e.g., in intellectual property) - yet R&D and IP teams spend half their time buried in manual work. We’re here to fix that. Ankar is building the AI operating system for innovation, reinventing how companies generate and protect their inventions. Our platform orchestrates how ideas become defensible IP with a suite of AI modules such as patent drafting, office action response, and infringement detection.

We’re at an inflection point:
- We’ve raised >24M to date from Tier-1 VCs like Atomico, Index Ventures, Norrsken, Daphni, and angels like the Founder of Hugging Face, CEO from Datadog, and Leaders from Deep Mind and OpenAI.
- We’re already working with the world’s most innovative companies including Fortune 500 company L’Oréal and global law firm Vorys.
- Expanding our world-class team with alumni from Palantir, Amazon, and BCG to tackle the 1T+ innovation market.

What you’ll be doing
We’re looking for a hands‑on generalist who can bridge product, engineering, and go‑to‑market — embedding with customers and internal teams to design, prototype, and deploy proofs of concept and new products.
- Lead end‑to‑end delivery of customer POCs and new product rollouts.
- Partner with customers to design and deliver high‑value POCs and new products.
- Work closely with customer teams to ensure successful adoption and value delivery.
- Turn customer feedback into clear product requirements.
- Spot emerging product opportunities across deployments.

What we are looking for
- 2+ years of experience in a high‑ownership environment (e.g., startups, consulting, banking, or similar fast‑moving roles).
- A builder’s mindset. You thrive in ambiguity, iterate quickly, and love creating order out of chaos.
- Extreme ownership. You see problems before they happen, you take responsibility, and you deliver.
- [Bonus points] Experience designing and delivering proof of concepts and new products to enterprise customers.

What else you might want to know
- Location: Hoxton Square, London (office-first policy with flexibility)
- Contract: Full‑time
- Compensation: Competitive salaries + substantial equity package under the tax‑efficient EMI scheme.
- Hiring process: (1) 30min introductory chat, (2) 2hr onsite interview, (3) 20min final in-person meeting.
- Visa sponsorship: Yes`,
